# PyTorch Basics Tutorial

A beginner-friendly introduction to PyTorch fundamentals.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This repository contains simple, well-commented examples covering:

1. **Tensors** - The fundamental data structure in PyTorch
2. **Autograd** - Automatic differentiation for computing gradients
3. **Linear Regression** - Building your first model
4. **Neural Network** - Creating a simple neural network

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neelsoumya/teaching_intro_pytorch.git
cd teaching_intro_pytorch
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

python -m venv venv_pytorch
source venv_pytorch/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv_pytorch\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Tutorial Structure

Run the scripts in order:

### 1. Tensors (`01_tensors.py`)
Learn about PyTorch tensors - the building blocks of deep learning. Basics of tensor creation, manipulation, and operations.
```bash
python 01_tensors.py
```

### 2. Autograd (`02_autograd.py`)
Understand automatic differentiation and how PyTorch computes gradients.
```bash
python 02_autograd.py
```

### 3. Neural Networks (`03_nn.py`)
Build and train a simple neural network using PyTorch.
```bash
python 03_nn.py
```

### 3. Linear Regression (`03_linear_regression.py`)
Build a simple linear regression model from scratch.
```bash
python 03_linear_regression.py
```

### 4. Neural Network (`04_neural_network.py`)
Create and train a basic neural network for classification.
```bash
python 04_neural_network.py
```

## 💡 Tips for Learning

- Read through each script before running it
- Try modifying the code and see what happens
- Each script is standalone and can be run independently
- Comments explain every important step
